# Custom layouts

`cascade` was originally inspired by Google Drive's that uses a variety of complex controls. For apps that want to create something similar, a batteries-included [CascadePopupWindow](https://github.com/saket/cascade/blob/trunk/cascade/src/main/java/me/saket/cascade/CascadePopupWindow.kt) is provided for use with custom layouts.

```kotlin
val popup = CascadePopupWindow(context)
popup.contentView.addView(CustomMenuView(context))  // Also see contentView.goBack().
popup.show(anchor)
```
