# cascade

![demo](demo.gif)

`cascade` builds nested popup menus with smooth height animations for Android. It is designed to be a *drop-in* replacement for both [PopupMenu](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/appcompat/widget/PopupMenu) and [DropdownMenu()](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/package-summary#DropdownMenu(kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.Function0,androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.ui.unit.DpOffset,androidx.compose.ui.window.PopupProperties,kotlin.Function1)), so using it in your project is beautifully only a word away. Try out the [sample app](https://github.com/saket/cascade/releases/download/1.3.0/cascade_v1.3.0_sample.apk) to see it in action.

See the [project website](https://saket.github.io/cascade) for full documentation.
